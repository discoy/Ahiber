Ahiber is android lib for sqlite.This lib use the hibernate tech to depart the db code from the java code,so if you are db manager you can't need to
care about the java logic,what you should do is write a effective db code for java coder.

All db code will be put in *.xml files and java coder should define the method which used in java code,then the db coder should impments the
method in *.xml.Ahiber will load all *.xml files and find the method in the file(the *.xml format will be descript in Ahiber/readme.txt).
Reflect will be used to map relation to object and annotaion will be used to map object property to field in db

This lib will use lib_utils so you should add below code in your gradle file

<b>
